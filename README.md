# Medical Record Storage System with Blockchain
This Python project aims to create a basic medical record storage system utilizing blockchain technology. The system is designed to ensure data integrity and security, leveraging Flask to develop the web application interface. Within the blockchain framework, data integrity is ensured through the use of SHA-256 hashing, while security is enhanced through a combination of RSA and AES encryption algorithms.


### Features:
- Blockchain Technology: Utilizes blockchain technology to store medical records securely and immutably.
- Data Integrity: Ensures data integrity using SHA-256 hashing algorithm, making it tamper-proof.
- Security: Enhances security through a combination of RSA and AES encryption algorithms for data encryption.
- User Authentication: Implements user authentication to ensure only authorized users can access and modify medical records.
- Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly web interface developed using Flask for seamless interaction with the system.
